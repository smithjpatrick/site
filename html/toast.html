                Toast, Inc. is a producer of point-of-sale hardware and software
                systems for restaurants. They want to increase the adoption of
                their self-order kiosks in restaurants to capitalize on the
                growing demand for kiosk technology in the food service
                industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Toast enlisted the help of my team and me to understand the
                needs of both restaurants and patrons with respect to kiosk
                usage and deliver a solution to address them.

              <p class="readable">
                After talking with restaurant patrons and managers, as well as
                looking at Toast's competitors, my team determined that a
                successful self-order kiosk should address the following areas:
              </p>
              <ul class="list__cards">
                <li class="list__card-item">
                  <svg class="card-item-icon" alt="" role="img">
                    <use href="#lightning-bolt"></use>
                  </svg>
                  <h3 class="h-xs">Fast ordering</h3>
                  <p>
                    People told us they expect to save time using a kiosk. We
                    heard them and provided functionality to get them in and out
                    quickly with their food.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <h3 class="h-xs">Personalization</h3>
                  <p>
                    We added a level of personalization so patrons can rely on
                    past orders to inform current decisions.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p>
                    We built in robust menu item modifications so patrons can
                    get exactly what they want without asking any questions.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p>
                    We incorporated upselling into the order flow to increase
                    average check sizes and restaurant revenue.

                exploration of potential solutions, which we tested with
                participants and later refined for presentation to the client.

              After an initial client meeting and interviews with a restaurant
              manager and patrons, my team learned that a successful design
              needed to support the goals of not just the end user, but also the
              actual customer of the kiosk itself - the restaurant owner or
              manager. To that end, our design focused on delivering
              improvements in the following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Time-savings.</strong> One of the primary reasons one
                may use a kiosk to order is to skip a long line and save
                themselves time, so our kiosk helps patrons get in and out more
                quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personalization.</strong> A preferred method of ordering
                is using one’s own mobile device. It’s more personal and allows
                users to act upon set preferences. We wanted to take advantage
                of purchasing history from repeat customers to provide a level
                of personalization on a public device.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Item modification.</strong> One of the top requests from
                restaurants is improved menu modifications, to cater to patron
                needs and also help generate revenue for restaurants.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Upselling.</strong> Kiosks have a higher potential to
                increase average check sizes, so we wanted to implement
                upselling opportunities that were appropriate and did not feel
                overly obtrusive.
